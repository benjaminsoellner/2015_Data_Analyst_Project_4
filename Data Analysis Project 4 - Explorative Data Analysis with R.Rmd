# Preparations

```{r Preparations}
setwd("h:/Dokumente/GitHub/2015_Data_Analyst_Project_4/")
prosper <- read.csv("project/prosperLoanData.csv")
str(prosper)
```

# First Observations from the Data Structure

## Eliminating fully correlating variables

## Potential Interesting Questions

# Final Plots and Summaries

**TODO:** at least 3 plots which do at least 2 of the following:

* draw comparisons
* identify trends
* engage a wide audience
* explain a complicated finding
* clarify a gap between perception and reality
* enable the reader to digest large amounts of information

# Reflection

**TODO:**

* Where did I run into difficulties?
* Where did I find successes?
* How could the analysis be enriched in the future (additional data and analyses)?
* Potentially: Decisions taken?
